   Sachiiiiiiin, Sachin!
</div>
    <div class="one"> <p> You’ve heard the chant. You may not have heard of the sport, but you’ve heard the chant. The chant - one that
        a billion people once lived by; one that would originate from the Wankhede and echo across the city and the
        seas. It is a name that continues to <span1> inspire many, not only in India, but all over the world,</span1> to take up the
        sport. Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar was that cricketer whose personality and aura upstaged any cricketing contest;
        yet he maintained that he wasn’t greater than than the game. To the people of India, the 5’5” giant of a man was
        much more than that. He was an emotion; <span2>a symbol of hope in a nation that revered him as nothing short of a God.</span2> 

        Ironically, in the midst of the over-the-top veneration and in spite of the pedestal he has been placed on, it
        is his humility and the ability to cast it all out that has allowed him to put forth his best performances on
        the international stage for <span3>over two decades. Having played across generations, Tendulkar </span3>  started playing Test
        cricket in a white shirt that could just as easily have been used as a school uniform, and scored his last Test
        hundred in a niche Nike jersey that was impossible to buy over the counter, and would later be auctioned for
        millions.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="two"> <p><h4> In a nutshell</h4>
        In the midst of all the constant adulation he has received over a significantly transitional period for cricket,
        commercially and otherwise, <span1> and in a sea of statistics that every Tendulkar-centric </span1>conversation attracts, it is
        sometimes easy to forget that he was perhaps the most complete batsman of his generation - one who combined
        natural talent with hard work and dedication; one who recognized the importance of shaping and polishing the
        diamond. This uncommon blend of dedication and <span2> ability made him stand out in the crowd, </span2>and made him the legend
        that is Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar.

        Tendulkar has been the single biggest factor behind the explosion of popularity that cricket enjoys in India
        which led to the Indian board becoming the richest and most powerful in world cricket. In a country already
        predisposed to cricket, <span3>Tendulkar gave the people a hero they </span3>  could look upto regardless of age, colour, creed
        or sect - and catapulted cricket from a sport to a religion in the subcontinent.</p> 
    </div>
    <div class="three"> <h4> The summit of all things cricket</h4>
       <p> In a game riddled with statistics, <span1> he owns almost every batting record worth owning, </span1>including that of the most
        runs in Test and ODI cricket, the most hundreds in the two formats, <span2> and the highest number of centuries</span2> in
        international cricket - a mind-numbing 100. Despite a tough start to his ODI career, Tendulkar found his calling
        at the top of the order when he was <span3> sent to open against New Zealand in 1994 </span3> and struck a 49-ball 82, and made
        the opening spot his own. He went on to compile 49 ODI hundreds by the end of his career - eclipsing the
        second-best by nineteen hundreds.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="four"> <h4>A World Cup veteran</h4>
      <p> Moreover, this <span1> career spanned over six World Cup appearances, </span1> from 1992 to 2011, in which he made two
        appearances in the final (2003 and 2011), finally getting his hands on the coveted trophy on that enchanting
        night in Mumbai on the 2nd of April 2011, <span3> getting the swan-song he deserved in front of his home crowd in
        Mumbai.</span3>
        <span2>
            <br>
        “He has carried the burden of the nation for 21 years; it’s time we carried him on our shoulders\" <br>
        - Virat Kohli’s words after his idol Sachin Tendulkar finally got his hands on the long-awaited World Cup
        trophy.</span2>
