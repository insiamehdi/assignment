    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Sachiiiiiiin, Sachin!</h1>

    <p style="background-color: beige;"> You’ve heard the chant. You may not have heard of the sport, but you’ve heard
        the chant. The chant - <span style="color:teal ;"> one that a
        billion people once lived by;</span> one that would originate from the Wankhede and echo across the city and the seas.
        It is a name that continues to inspire many, not only in India, but all over the world, to take up the sport.
        Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar was that <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"> cricketer  whose personality and aura upstaged any cricketing contest; </span>  yet he
        maintained that he wasn’t greater than than the game. To the people of India, the 5’5” giant of a man was much
        more than that. He was an emotion; <span style="text-decoration: underline;"> a symbol of hope in a nation that revered him as nothing short of a God.</span></p>

    <p style="background-color: rgb(218, 214, 9);"> Ironically, in the midst of the <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"> over-the-top veneration</span> and in spite of the
        pedestal he has been placed on, it
        is his<span style="color:rgb(128, 15, 0) ;">  humility and the ability to cast</span>  it all out that has allowed him to put forth his best performances on
        the international stage for over two decades. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Having played across generations, Tendulkar </span>started playing Test
        cricket in a white shirt that could just as easily have been used as a school uniform, and scored his last Test
        hundred in a niche Nike jersey that was impossible to buy over the counter, and would later be auctioned for
        millions.</p>

    <h4>In a nutshell</h4>
    <p style="background-color: chocolate;"> In the midst of all the constant adulation he has received over a
        significantly transitional period for cricket,
        commercially and otherwise,<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> and in a sea of statistics that every Tendulkar-centric conversation attracts,</span> it is
        sometimes easy to<span style="color:rgb(19, 0, 128) ;">  forget that he was perhaps the most complete</span>  batsman of his generation - one who combined
        natural talent with  hard work and<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">  dedication; one who recognized the importance of shaping and polishing the</span> 
        diamond. This uncommon blend of dedication and ability made him stand out in the crowd, and made him the legend
        that is Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar.

        Tendulkar has been the single biggest factor behind the explosion of popularity that cricket enjoys in India
        which led to the Indian board becoming the richest and most powerful in world cricket. In a country already
        predisposed to cricket, Tendulkar gave the people a hero they could look upto regardless of age, colour, creed
        or sect - and catapulted cricket from a sport to a religion in the subcontinent.</p>

    <h4>The summit of all things cricket</h4>
    <p style="background-color: tomato;"> In a game riddled with statistics, he owns almost every batting record worth
        owning, including that of the most
        runs in Test and ODI cricket,<span style="text-decoration: underline;">the most hundreds in the two formats, and the highest number of centuries in</span> 
        international cricket -<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">  a mind-numbing 100.</span>  Despite a tough start to his ODI career, Tendulkar found his calling
        at the top of the <span style="color:rgb(112, 212, 18) ;"> order when he was sent to open against New Zealand in 1994 and </span> struck a 49-ball 82, and made
        the opening spot his own. He went on to compile 49 ODI hundreds by the end of his career - eclipsing the
        second-best by nineteen hundreds.</p>

    <h4>A World Cup veteran</h4>
    <p style="background-color: salmon;">
        Moreover, this <span style="text-decoration: underline;"> career spanned over six World Cup appearances,</span> from 1992 to 2011, in which he made two
        appearances in the<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">  final (2003 and 2011), </span> finally getting his hands on the<span style="color:rgb(231, 235, 6) ;">  coveted trophy on that enchanting</span> 
        night in Mumbai on the 2nd of April 2011, getting the swan-song he deserved in front of his home crowd in
        Mumbai.</p>
